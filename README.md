# Image-Classification
  - Use Deep Learning models from scratch like (Xception, DenseNet, AlexNet, AlexNet with Transformer)
  - Apply the appropriate data preparation steps :
    - Image Preprocessing :
         - Convert image from BGR to RGB
         - Resizing Images
         - Normalize Image by Dividing by Maximum

    - Data Augmentation For Train Like:
         - Horizontal flip
         - Vertical flip
         - Rotation range by 40
         - Width shift range  
         - Height shift range
         - Zoom range  
         - Fill mode by Nearest

  - submit results on Kaggle competition and rank the best accuracy achieved in the competition.
